# Music-Player
CodeClause Python Development Internship Project-2


Task 2 - Music Player

I have successfully completed Task 2 of my Python Development internship at CodeClause!

ðŸŽµ Task 2: Music Player
In this task, I created a music player that allows users to select their music folder and play songs by simply clicking on them. Users can also navigate to the next or previous song, pause, and stop the music with intuitive buttons.

This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I'm excited to continue developing my skills in Python. Thank you, CodeClause, for this amazing opportunity!

Features:
- Select music folder
- Play songs by clicking on them
- Navigate to next or previous song
- Pause and stop functionality
